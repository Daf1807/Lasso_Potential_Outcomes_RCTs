# 1.1 Suppose you estimate LASSO with a very large Î» and with a very small Î»
# Describe qualitatively how the coefficients and training/test error behave in both cases.
################################################################################

# ðŸ”¹ When Î» is very large (the lasso is very short and tight):
# - The coefficients are heavily penalized, many shrink to zero.
# - The model becomes very simple â†’ underfitting.
# - Training error: high, because the model does not fit well.
# - Test error: also high, since it fails to capture the true signal.
#
# ðŸ”¹ When Î» is very small (the lasso is long and barely tight):
# - The coefficients are hardly penalized, they remain large.
# - The model fits the data too much â†’ overfitting.
# - Training error: very low.
# - Test error: tends to be high because the model memorizes noise instead of generalizing.

# 1.2 Explain what cross-validation is and why it is useful in machine learning. 
# Illustrate with a sketch of how data is split.
################################################################################

# Cross-validation is a technique that splits the data into several groups called folds.
# In each iteration, one fold is used as validation and the others as training.
# This process is repeated until all folds have been used as validation.
# At the end, the results are averaged.
#
# This is useful in machine learning because:
# - It allows for a better evaluation of model performance.
# - It avoids relying on a single train/test split.
# - It helps in selecting hyperparameters (for example, the optimal value of Î» in LASSO).
